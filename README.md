# Circles
Android application for Citrus Hacks 2015.
<br />We wanted to solve the issue of creating and organizing study groups for our courses. Getting together for study groups is a common issue many students face.
<br />The users can log in and create events. Other students can then view and join events. There is also a message option to leave notes on events. Participants for events are able to view comments on events and add to the conversation.
